		<p>"I didn't know there was a charm," answered Dorothy, in surprise. "What is it?"</p>
		<p>"It is written inside the Golden Cap," replied the Queen of the Mice. "But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us."</p>
		<p>"Won't they hurt me?" asked the girl anxiously.</p>
		<p>"Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!" And she scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.</p>
		<p>Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.</p>
		<p>"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing on her left foot.</p>
		<p>"What did you say?" asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was doing.</p>
		<p>"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went on, standing this time on her right foot.</p>
		<p>"Hello!" replied the Tin Woodman calmly.</p>
		<p>"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.</p>
